# lain_derive

Core functionality for proc macros used in [lain](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/lain). Do not refer to this crate directly and instead use the macros re-exported from `lain`.

NOTE: Much of this crate is re-implemented and cherry-picked from [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/)'s derive crate. Thanks to the serde developers for their work.
